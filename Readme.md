# 🔐 Authentication Project

This project is a basic authentication system with sign-in and sign-up forms. You can switch between the forms using tabs. The buttons are only enabled when all the input fields are filled correctly. In the future, we plan to add Firebase Authentication to this project.

## ✨ Features

- **📝 Sign-Up Form**: Collects user's name, email, password, and confirm password.
- **🔑 Sign-In Form**: Collects user's email and password.
- **✅ Form Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled before enabling the submit button.
- **🔄 Dynamic Form Switching**: Allows switching between sign-in and sign-up forms using tabs.
- **🔒 Password Confirmation**: Checks if password and confirm password fields match during sign-up.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- 🌐 HTML
- 🎨 CSS
- ⚙️ JavaScript

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **🔥 Firebase Authentication**: Implement user authentication using Firebase, including email/password sign-in, Google Sign-In, and other OAuth providers.
- **🛡️ Form Validation**: Add more robust validation and error handling.
- **📢 User Feedback**: Provide user feedback for successful sign-up/sign-in and display error messages for failed attempts.
